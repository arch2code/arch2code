= Block Diagram of inAndOut example

This example is used to show SystemVerilog generation. This example was also used to test the moduleSignalBlast template used to generate a verilator friendly wrapper that has signals instead of interfaces at the top level. This is needed until verilator supports interfaces at the top level of verilation. The *SSoT* for this example can be found in the `examples/inAndOut` directory at the root of the https://bitbucket.org/arch2code/arch2code/src/main/[code repository].
