== Introduction
Arch2Code is an EDA tool written in `python`. Arch2Code processes sources written in the YAML file format. These input sources are a **S**ingle **S**ource of **T**ruth, *SSoT*, for the acthiectue that it defines.
Arch2Code can then take this *SSoT* and generate many outputs. Some examples:

1. Block and chip level specifications
2. SystemVerilog (RTL) code interface connectivity
3. SystemVerilog code for APB address decode & register CSR (Control and Status Register) decode
4. SystemVerilog (DV) connectivity
5. SystemC interface connectivity

In an *SSoT* architecture all of the following can be defined; constants, types, variables, structures, interfaces, registers, memories, blocks, and instances of blocks. All connectivity between instances can be defined using the interfaces, structures, variables and so on. The result is that a single change to the bit width can be easily propogated to all code and documentation at the push of a button.
