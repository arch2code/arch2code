= How To Run Without docker

_note:_ This method is not recommended, instead use this xref:usage.adoc[method].

== Prerequisites

* A proper shell; bash from ubuntu, bash from WSL (Windows System for Linux), zsh Mac OS.
* java runtime environment (java)
* graphviz
* python3 >= 3.10 (tested with 3.10.6)
* Jinja

== Install Python libraries

The python libraries can be updated using ```pip3``` or ```pip```. Usually ```pip``` will work if you only have python3 on your machine. If you have both python2 and python3 you may need to use the ```pip3``` command.

Run one of the following commands to get the required python libraries; ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.

_note: plantuml is used but the jar file is in the pu_jar directory in the A2C repository_

== Explore

Last, explore the commands used in the `Makefile` to build different example architectures with different output generations.
