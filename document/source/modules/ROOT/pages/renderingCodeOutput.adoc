= Rendering Output

Output can be generated using either a Jinja or Python custom renderer, controlled in the
appropriate config file. The rendering uses GENERATED_CODE_BEGIN and 
GENERATED_CODE_END to bracket out the code to be generated. These lines should be commented
out in language specific manner. GENERATED_CODE_BEGIN also has command line parameters
such as --template=includes --section=constants to allow passing in information to the renderer.

The renderer takes these input parameters and the database and converts into code.
