See `builder/base/rules/systemc-testbench.md` for testbench-specific guidance.

Key points:
- Separate stimulus generation from checking
- Use scoreboards for out-of-order completion
- Log important events at `LOG_IMPORTANT`, pass/fail at `LOG_ALWAYS`
- Use random seeds for reproducibility
- Initialize all DUT state before starting stimulus
