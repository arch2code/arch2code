See `builder/base/rules/systemverilog-rtl.md` for RTL guidance.

Key points:
- NEVER edit between `GENERATED_CODE_BEGIN` and `GENERATED_CODE_END`
- Use `logic` over `reg/wire`
- Use `always_ff` for sequential, `always_comb` for combinational
- Import packages: `import <module>_package::*;`
- Lint with `make lint` in rtl directory
