See `builder/base/rules/architecture-yaml.md` for YAML architecture guidance.

Key points:
- YAML is the Single Source of Truth
- Define in order: constants → types → structures → interfaces → blocks → instances → connections
- Width is REQUIRED for non-enum types
- Manually create top-level bus decoders (block-level `_regs` are auto-generated)
- Connections only work within the SAME container
