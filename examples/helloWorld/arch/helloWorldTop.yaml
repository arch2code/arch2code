### value: followed by a number to indicate the value for this constant, required if eval is not used
### desc: followed by a string is a description of this constant, required
### eval: optional in place of value, this is a math function that can be used to make a constant from other constant

#### structureName: followed by a string is a key reference to the structures dictionary
#### structureType: followed by a string, the structureType is what the structureName gets bound to during generation
####                    a System Verilog interface may have more than one structureType defined and that is what each 
####                    structureName gets bound to during generation, similar for System C
### desc: followed by a string is a description of this interface, required

# blocks these are subsystems or blocks that can be instanced one or more times
## blockname: followed by a name that gives this object (block) a unique key
### portname: followed by a name that gives this port a unique key for this block, this is used when a block is instanced
###           more than once or if a port is instanced more than once to connect to multiple blocks with the same interface, optional
#### count: number that indicates how many of these portname exist and can be connected, optional
####          numbered from 0 upto count - 1
blocks:

    blockGroup: blockTop
  consumer:

# instances, these are instantiations of objects
#   implies a top level of some kind that is instancing objects, an instance can instance other objects, optional nesting
## instancename: is the instance name being instanced, required
### instanceType: followed by a string which is the key to finding which object is being instanced (objectname), required
### color: followed by a string which is a color (provide link to valid colors) this adds a color to diagrams
###          for this instance, optional (currently does not work in diagram generation code)
instances:
  uTop:
    container: top # self referential

    addressMap: False

# connections are specify interface connections between different instaces of objects
## - {}, dash followed by a dictionary, connections is a list of dictionaries
### interfacename: followed by string that is a key to this interface, an interface can be connected 1 or more times
### src: followed by a name of the source / master instance for this conneciton
### dst: followed by a name of the destination / slave instance for this conneciton
### count: followed by a number to indicate the number of ports to connect to, only valid with srcport or dstport and an interfacename that has multiple ports
###
### ports are optional, and are implied in most use cases. The exception is where disambiguation is needed, mainly in array use cases
### srcport: used if there is more than one objectname instance of the source / master, declares the port of source objectname to connect to
### dstport: used if there is more than one objectname instance of destination / slave, declares the port of destination objectname to connect to
### color: followed by a string which is a color (provide link to valid colors) this adds a color to diagrams
###          for this connection, optional (currently does not work in diagram generation code)
connections:
  - {interface: test_rdy_vld,                   src: uProducer,    dst: uConsumer }

  - {interface: test_pop_ack,                   src: uProducer,    dst: uConsumer }


# flows, are very similar to a plantuml sequence diagram, a filename is taken and optionally
#   consistency checks can be made for connections the flow
## filenames:
### - , dash followed by a string indicates the filename for each flow
####    inside each flow a connection can be indicated and checked for consistency
####    the format for consistency check and connection replacement in a flow must follow the below format
####    instance operator instance : connectionKey '''process'''
####    For example
####    uBlocka -> uBlockc0 : cs_stuff '''process'''
#####     spaces are recuired between each item in the string, the word proccess inside triple ticks
#####     is also needed without spaces to aid in processing
